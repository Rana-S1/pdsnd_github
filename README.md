### Project Title
The title of the project is bikeashare

### Description
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.
This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B,
though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride.
Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
